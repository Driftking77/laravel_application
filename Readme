Overview:- 
****
*This project architecture leverages a Kubernetes cluster to deploy a Laravel application, which is divided into frontend and backend components. The application interacts with a Python Flask API that connects to an Azure MySQL PaaS database. The infrastructure is managed using Terraform and automated through Jenkins CI/CD pipelines, utilizing Powershell and Python scripts.*

*Components
1. Kubernetes Cluster
Deployment - Laravel Frontend: This involves a Kubernetes deployment that manages the Laravel frontend pods. It uses a ReplicaSet (RS) for managing pod replication.
Deployment - Laravel Backend: Similar to the frontend, the backend Laravel application is deployed in a separate Kubernetes deployment, managing its own pods through a ReplicaSet.
2. Ingress Controller
The Ingress Controller manages external access to the services in the Kubernetes cluster, using a public IP and routing traffic to the appropriate frontend and backend services based on the incoming request.
3. Python Flask API
A standalone API developed using Flask, responsible for handling certain application logic and connecting to the database.
4. Azure MySQL PaaS
A managed MySQL database hosted on Azure, providing database services for the application.
5. Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline
Terraform: Infrastructure as code tool used for setting up and managing the Kubernetes cluster and other cloud resources.
Powershell and Python: Scripts used within Jenkins pipelines to automate deployment processes and other operational tasks.*

Setup Instructions

Prerequisites:-

Kubernetes cluster
Azure account
Jenkins installed and configured
Terraform installed
Powershell and Python installed on the Jenkins server

Maintenance:-
Scaling: You can scale the deployments by adjusting the replicas in the Kubernetes deployment manifests.
Monitoring: Set up monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to keep track of the cluster's health and performance.
Updates: Use the Jenkins pipeline to automate updates and deployments.

Feedback:-
This setup ensures a scalable, manageable, and automated deployment of a Laravel application using modern DevOps practices. The separation of concerns and use of Kubernetes, Azure services, and CI/CD pipelines help in maintaining a robust and efficient workflow.
